## Abstract
*In recent years, information technology is playing
an increasingly prominent role in the field of "Life
Science," through the development of applications
that enable the analysis or prediction of phenomena
biology. Starting from a biological problem such as
increasing bee mortality and a biochemical and risk
assessment study, which seeks to relate relate this
mortality to the prediction of the interaction of pe-
sticides with bee proteins, an attempt was made to
implement/design software capable of capable of au-
tomating a series of procedures to make this type of
analysis more accessible to researchers with very dif-
ferent computer science backgrounds. The software
created is called AUtomated DOcking 4 RIsk AS-
sessment (AUDO4RIAS), and it brings together in a
single application different bioinformatics functions
and tools. In particular, this software was developed
with the the goal of creating an application capable
of automating: (i) the processes of preparing inputs
for molecular docking analysis, including searching
and downloading the 3D structures of molecules (li-
gands and receptors), (ii) the execution of the ana-
lysis of molecular docking, and (iii) the analysis of
the results of the protein/ligand interaction predic-
tion. The software is available on GitHub, released
under a license Creative Commons.
